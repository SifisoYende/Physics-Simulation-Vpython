# 3D Physics Simulation (VPython)

### Project Overview
This project is a 3D simulation of a bouncing ball within a bounded box, developed to demonstrate the application of vector mathematics in software engineering.

### Key Features
*   **Vector Math:** Uses real-time vector addition for position and velocity updates.
*   **Collision Logic:** Implements boundary-check algorithms to simulate elastic bounces.
*   **Visualization:** Features a dynamic velocity arrow and motion trail for visual debugging.

### How to Run
1. Install VPython: `pip install vpython`
2. Run the script: `python main.py`
